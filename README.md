# calculadora-alexa

I created this skill to help kids with ADHD to solve their homework so they can focus on the math problems and not the arithmetic. 

Since ADHD kids don't have a great span on working memory, adding the
feature to solve basic operations with an Alexa Skill helps them
to focus on the problem. Also with an Alexa Skill they seem to be more engaged.
